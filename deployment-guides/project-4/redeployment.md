# Redeploying a Django App

* Make the changes needed to the app, running in regular development mode as normal

* When complete, rebuild the frontend, so from `frontend` run the command `npm run build` or `yarn build`

* Add, commit and re run `git push heroku master`

* The changes may take 10 - 20 minutes to appear on heroku
